        <p>

            Haxx.nz is a collective of software developers, designers and makers of all kinds who build things for fun.
            The projects we taken on or maintain range from silly proof of concept ideas, to free open source tools that
            do social good in New
            Zealand.
            <br /><br />
            If you’ve got
            skills and want to collaboratively build something, or want to meet like minded people to work on stuff with
            then jump in! We also <a href="/">accept requests to maintain projects</a> that you no longer want to
            support, but might still have real users.
