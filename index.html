            Haxx.nz are a collective of software developers, designers and makers of all kinds who build things for fun.
            The projects we work on range from silly proof of concept ideas, to free open source tools
            that
            do social good.
            <br /><br />
            If youâ€™ve got
            skills, or want to learn how to collaboratively build something, join the crew on Discord. it's a great way
            to meet people to build stuff with.
